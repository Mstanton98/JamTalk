# JamTalk

An application that allows you to discover new trending music on a a daily basis,
and provides you with various chatrooms to talk about it in.  Uses the SoundCloud API
to get new songs. The most valuable feedback on our project was to make sure that the
chat box stayed at the bottom when you added a new line. The biggest challenge we overcame
was getting socket.io working properly for each room.
